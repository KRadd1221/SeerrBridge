## üöÄ What is SeerrBridge?

üåâ **SeerrBridge** is a browser automation tool that integrates [Jellyseer](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)/[Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) with [Debrid Media Manager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager). It listens to movie requests via Overseerr webhook. It automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

üõ†Ô∏è **Why SeerrBridge?** 

**SeerrBridge** eliminates the need to set up multiple applications like [Radarr](https://radarr.video/), [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett), [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr), and other download clients. With SeerrBridge, you streamline your media management into one simple, automated process. No more juggling multiple tools‚Äîjust request and download!

Simply put, I was too lazy to set up all of these other applications (arrs) and thought.... I want this instead.

### (THIS SCRIPT IS STILL IN BETA)

## ‚öô Requirements

Before you can run this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. **Jellyseerr / Overseerr Notifications**
  - SeerrBridge should be running on the same machine that Jellyseerr / Overseerr is running on.
  - You will navigate to Settings > Notifications > Webhook > Turn it on, and configure as shown below

     ```bash
     http://localhost:8000/jellyseer-webhook/
     ```

### 2. **Real-Debrid Account**
   - You will need a valid [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) account to authenticate and interact with the Debrid Media Manager.
     - The Debrid Media Manager Access token, Client ID, Client Secret, & Refresh Tokens are used and should be set within your .env file. Grab this from your browser via Inspect > 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c718851c-60d4-4750-b020-a3edb990b53b)

This is what you want to copy from your local storage and set in your .env:

    {"value":"your_token","expiry":123} | YOUR_CLIENT_ID | YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET | YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN

### 3. **ChromeDriver**
   - [ChromeDriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) is required to automate browser tasks using Selenium.
     - Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your installed version of Google Chrome.
       - Download it manually and provide the path in your `.env` file.

### 4. **Python 3.10.11+**
   - The bot requires **Python 3.10.11** or higher. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 5. **Required Python Libraries**
   - You can install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

---

### Example `.env` File

Create a `.env` (or rename the example .env) file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=path-to-chromedriver
RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"YOUR_TOKEN","expiry":123456789}
TRAKT_API_KEY=YOUR_TRAKT_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_BASE=https://YOUR_OVERSEERR_URL.COM
```

## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] **Faster Processing**: Implement concurrency to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- [ ] **TV Show Support**: Extend functionality to handle TV series and episodes.
- [ ] **DMM Token**: Ensure access token permanence/refresh
- [x] **Jellyseer/Overseer API Integration**: Direct integration with Jellyseer/Overseer API for smoother automation and control.
- [x] **Title Parsing**: Ensure torrent titles/names are properly matched and handle different languages.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Seerr Webhook**: SeerrBridge listens for movie requests via the configured webhook.
2. **Automated Search**: It uses Selenium to automate the search for movies on Debrid Media Manager site.
3. **Torrent Fetching**: Once a matching torrent is found, SeerrBridge automates the Real-Debrid download process.
4. **Queue Management**: Requests are added to a queue and processed one by one, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

If you want to see the automation working in real-time, you can edit the code and add a # to the headless line

This will launch a visible Chrome browser. Be sure not to mess with it while it's operating or else you will break the current action/script and need a re-run.
